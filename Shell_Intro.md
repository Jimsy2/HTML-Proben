Introduction
The
purpose
of
this
document
is to
provide
the
reader
with
a fast
and
simple
introduction
to
using
the
Linux
command
shell
and
some
of
its
basic
utilities.
It is assumed
that
the
reader
has
zero
or
very
limited
exposure
to
the
Linux
command
prompt.
This
document
is designed
to
accompany
an
instructor-led
tutorial
on
this
subject,
and
therefore
some
details
have
been
left
out.
Explanations,
practical examples, and references to DOS commands are made, where appropriate.
